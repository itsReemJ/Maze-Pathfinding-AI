# Maze-Pathfinding-AI
"An AI project implementing BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First Search, and A* algorithms to find paths in a maze using Python and OpenCV.

# Maze Pathfinding AI

This project demonstrates pathfinding algorithms for navigating a maze. It was developed as a **group project** by four senior students. The AI finds optimal paths using several search algorithms and visualizes them on a maze image.

## Features
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
- A* Search
- Visualization of paths on maze images using OpenCV

## How It Works
1. Load a maze image (white pixels are walkable, black are walls).
2. Choose a search algorithm.
3. Input start and target coordinates.
4. The AI finds and displays the optimal path on the maze.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Queue (for priority handling)
